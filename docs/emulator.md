## Common Issues

### Images Not Showing

If images don't appear in Canvas after import:

1. Ensure images are in the `items/` folder
2. Check that image paths are relative
3. For R/Python-generated figures, verify they're rendered before conversion

### "Couldn't determine correct answers"

This error means Canvas can't find the `correctResponse` element:

1. Mark at least one answer as correct in your Markdown
2. Use `[correct]` suffix, checkmark `✓`, or bold `**answer**`

## Pro Tips

!!! tip "Run Before Import"
    Always run the emulator before uploading to Canvas to catch issues early.

!!! tip "R/Python Figures"
    Generate all figures with Quarto/RMarkdown *before* running the converter.
